Would you like to win a bit of money? Lets wager on a card game for minor stakes. In front of
you is a shuffled deck of cards. All 52 cards lie face-down. Half the cards are red and half are
black. I will proceed to flip the cards over, one by one. If the last card I flip over is red, you’ll
win a dollar. Otherwise, you will lose a dollar.
Here’s the twist; you can ask me to halt the game at any time. Once you say "halt", I will flip
over the next card and end the game. That next card will serve as the final card. You will win a
dollar if it’s red.
We can play the game as many times as you like. The deck will be reshuffled every time. After
each round, we’ll exchange money. What is your best approach to winning this game?
